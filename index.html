<p> I love nature </p>
    <p>
            What beautiful things surround you? From regal snowcapped mountain ranges or transparent aquamarine ocean waters, </br>
            the beauties that nature offers delight people around the globe. When you love something,  </br>
            you want to talk about it. Sometimes there are no words, </br>
             but sometimes thereâ€™s a perfect expression to capture the awesomeness of natural sights.
